# Luiza Salum

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luiza Salum, a bachelor's student at NOVA IMS.

## My Projects

### Computation III Final Project - Car Racer (Lolly Locket's Dog Chase)
- This project challenged me to leverage OOP principles and enhance user experience through a functional and engaging game.
- Used Python and Pygame
- Drew every element of the game using Clip Studio Pro
- Based on the "Polly Party Pickup" game from 2007 ([Wiki](https://pollypocket.fandom.com/wiki/Polly_Party_Pickup))
- Check out the code [here](https://github.com/LuizaSalum/NOVAIMS_COMP3)!
